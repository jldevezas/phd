						<h3>Global Listening Behavior</h3>
						<p>
							We've grouped data by the hour of the day and analyzed behavior by gender and country.
							While male and female music listening behaviors are very similar, listening habits seem
							to behave differently for different countries.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="vertical-space">
						<h4>Hourly by Gender</h4>

						<p>
							Below you can find an hourly chart for the total number of plays in the dataset,
							distinguishing between male, female and unknown genders.
						</p>

						<h4>Hourly by Country</h4>

						<p>
							Here you can see the hourly music plays distribution for each country in the dataset.
							Each bar indicates the fraction of music listened in the given country at each hour of
							the day.  We've sorted facets from the country with the most global plays to the
							country with the least global plays. We've also clustered similar hourly behavior using
							k-means on this normalized hourly data. We used <em>k</em>=3 which resulted in the
							cluster that achieved the best silhouette value among the clusters generated with
							<em>k</em> from 2 to 6.
						</p>

						<p>
							Note that in the original dataset, timestamps were in the UTC time standard. In order
							to offer a fair comparison between countries, we shifted the hour in each country by
							the mean time zone offset. Also notice that, as we approach the countries at the
							bottom, there is less data supporting those countries behaviors.
						</p>

						<div class="vertical-space content-center">
							<img src="img/charts/hourly_scrobbles_by_country.png"/>
						</div>

						<p>
							The following two charts illustrate the two different behaviors identified by the
							clustering process. At first, we thought averaging the time zone would have influenced
							the minimum shifting, however we found out that the countries in both clusters have a
							variable number of time zones, which indicates that it wasn't a factor that highly
							influenced the clustering.
						</p>
						
						<div class="vertical-space">
							<h5>Behavior 1</h5>
							<p>
								This depicts a country that is either more active during the night, sleeping late,
								or who has people with many different schedules. It includes countries like China
								who are well known for their intensive working habits.
							</p>
							<div class="content-center">
								<img src="img/charts/hourly_scrobbles_by_country_behavior_1.png"/>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="vertical-space">
							<h5>Behavior 2</h5>
							<p>
								This depicts a country with low activity during the night, and that listens to
								music frequently while awake. It includes most of the countries, depicting the
								expected behavior of inactivity during the night.
							</p>
							<div class="content-center">
								<img src="img/charts/hourly_scrobbles_by_country_behavior_2.png"/>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>
							Even though there are two distinctive listening habits among different countries, we
							believe they are not very different overall and that they do not deviate much from the
							expected behavior.
