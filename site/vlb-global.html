						<h4>Global Analysis</h4>
						<p>We've grouped data by the hour of the day and analyzed behavior by gender and country.
							While male and female music listening behaviors are very similar, listening habits seem
							to behave differently for different countries.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="ink-vspace">
						<h5>Hourly by Gender</h5>

						<p>Below you can find an hourly chart for the total number of plays in the dataset,
							distinguishing between male, female and unknown genders.</p>

						<div class="ink-vspace">

						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="ink-vspace">
						<h5>Hourly by Country</h5>

						<p>Here you can see the hourly music plays distribution for each country in the dataset. Each
							bar indicates the fraction of music listened in the given country at each hour of the day.
							We've sorted facets from the country with the most global plays to the country with the least
							global plays. We've also clustered similar hourly behavior using k-means on this normalized
							hourly data. We used <em>k</em>=3 which resulted in the cluster that achieved the best
							silhouette value among the clusters generated with <em>k</em> from 2 to 6.</p>

						<p>Note that in the original dataset, timestamps were in the UTC time standard. In order to
							offer a fair comparison between countries, we shifted the hour in each country by the mean
							time zone offset. Also notice that, as we approach the countries at the bottom, there is
							less data supporting those countries behaviors.</p>

						<div class="ink-vspace">
							<img src="img/charts/hourly_scrobbles_by_country.png"/>
						</div>

						<p>The following two charts illustrate the two different behaviors identified by the clustering
							process. At first, we thought averaging the time zone would have influenced the minimum shifting,
							however we found out that the countries in both clusters have a variable number of time zones,
							which indicates that it wasn't a factor that highly influenced the clustering.</p>
						
						<div class="ink-vspace">
							<h6>Behavior 1</h6>
							<p>This depicts a country that is either more active during the night, sleeping late, or
								who has people with many different schedules. It includes countries like China who are
								well known for their intensive working habits.</p>
							<img src="img/charts/hourly_scrobbles_by_country_behavior_1.png"/>
						</div>

						<div class="ink-vspace">
							<h6>Behavior 2</h6>
							<p>This depicts a country with low activity during the night, and that listens to music
								frequently while awake. It includes most of the countries, depicting the expected
								behavior of inactivity during the night.</p>
							<img src="img/charts/hourly_scrobbles_by_country_behavior_2.png"/>
						</div>

						<p>Even though there are two distinctive listening habits among different countries, we
							believe they are not very different overall and that they do not deviate much from the
							expected behavior.</p>
