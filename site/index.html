						<h3>About Me and My PhD</h3>

						<p>
							My name is Jos√© Devezas and I'm a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science of
							the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto. I am researching methodologies to
							improve music discovery, specially as a group activity, by taking into account the
							information given by the communities and social ties of the individuals that make the
							group.
						</p>

						<p>
							In here, you will find any material that I develop as part of my PhD, and that I deem
							useful for the community. This includes studies, theoretical clarifications and
							explanations, and algorithms, tools or visualizations, as a side-product of each phase
							of my work.
						</p>

						<h3>Studies</h3>

						<p>
							We begin by presenting an exploratory analysis, supported on data visualization,
							depicting the hourly, weekly and monthly behavior, globally as well as for individual
							users, based on the <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> dataset provided by Oscar
							Celma, which comprises scrobble information for nearly 1,000 users crawled randomly
							from his neighborhood. This data can	be found <a
								href="http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-1K.html">here</a>.
							Available analyses include a set of <a
								href="individual-listening-behavior.html">user-centric interactive
								visualizations</a>, as well as a set of <a
								href="global-listening-behavior.html">global overview plots</a>.

						<h3>Theory</h3>

						<p>
							I take quite a pride in understanding concepts with enough detail, so that I can then
							convey the ideas in layman's terms. I believe that the mastery of a subject requires
							being able to transmit knowledge in a way that makes it seem trivial for the learner.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the theory sections, I present this kind of approach, trying to pass knowledge as if
							I were explaining it to a friend, instead of formally as is the case of the majority of
							the bibliography out there. This is the kind of contribution you will find in this
							website. If however you're still interested in the formal approach of this same
							content, you can read my thesis when I finish my PhD, around the year 2017. For now,
							you can read about <a href="latent-factor-models.html">singular value decomposition</a>
							and <a href="k-fold-cross-validation.html">k-fold cross-validation</a> in the context
							of recommender systems.
						</p>

						<h3>Tools</h3>

						<p>
							In the process of understanding the algorithms I'm studying and as an engineer, I'm
							implementing code that will function as my workbench, but also as an open source
							resource for anyone interested in the same subjects. Even if not quite
							production-ready, it poses a good resource to easily test and extend on recommendation
							algorithms.
						</p>

						<p>
							Most of these implementations will be available through <a href="pyjld.html">PyJLD</a>,
							a Python library for the study of recommender systems. The mission is to implement and
							experiment with several recommendation algorithms, but also to integrate into the
							recommendation process any knowledge obtained through algorithms that harness the
							information of social networks, including the community structure. Therefore, we also
							make it the mission of PyJLD to provide implementations to algorithms for community
							detection and social network analysis in general.
